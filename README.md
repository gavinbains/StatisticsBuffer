# HoneyBee Robotics Software Assessment

Software Assessment for Summer Internship at HoneyBee

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes
on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have g++ installed in your environment or have a method of
compiling and running C++ code on your terminal.

g++ comes native on most \*nix systems but in case you dont have it simply run:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++
```
For windows, the following guides are useful to follow:

If you would like to use Cygwin:
```

```

if you would like to use MinGW
```
http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started
```

### Compiling

Just run the Makefile while in its directory!

```
make
```

This should result in new object files called `DataContainer.o` and `StatisticsBuffer.o` along with
an executable called `main`

## Running the Program

To start, just run the executable or type:

```
./main
```

## Assignment3

Go ahead and take a look at `Assignment3.txt` for my answers to that part of the assessment. Most of the Threading work
I have done has been on Java, but it was fun getting to research and learn more about threading in C++!
